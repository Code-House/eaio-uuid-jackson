= Eaio UUID Jackson

This repository hosts an a very small piece of code needed to turn com.eaio.uuid.UUID type into valid string representation
as well as read it from string representation. By default Jackson does have support for "fromString" deserialization however
it does not allow to enrich "fromString" types.

== Usage
Pulling in eaio types in your code requires no extra work, however making Jackson aware of custom type logic will require
such small amount of object mapping customization:
```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper().registerModule(new EaioUUIDModule());
```
